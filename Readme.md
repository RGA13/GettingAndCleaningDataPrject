Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

run_analysis.R gets and cleans the data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set provided by the Machine Learning Repository of UCI. You can learn more from the original data set at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

This script will automatically download and process the data. The transformations and the output of run_analysis is detailed in the CodeBook.md provided in this repository.

To run the script please follow these instructions:

1. Get run_analysis.R from the github repo to your local working directory

2. Start RStudio and open run_analysis.R in RStudio

3. Make sure you have internet connection when running run_analysis.R as it will download the data (if not already present in the working directory)

4. Make sure R packages data.table and reshape2 are installed. If not, please install them.

5. Highlight all content of run_analysis.R (by clicking in the run_analysis.R source window and then ctrl-A to select all), then click on the Run button at the top-right of the run_analysis.R source window.

run_analysis.R contains detailed comments on what the R script is doing.
